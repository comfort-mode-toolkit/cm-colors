# CM-Colors v0.4.0 Release Notes

**Color contrast that works for everyone**

We've made CM-Colors smarter and more flexible, so you can make your website readable without fighting with color codes.

## What's New

### Smarter Color Fixing
We've upgraded our engine to find readable colors more often, even for tricky combinations. You'll see fewer "could not tune" messages and more green checkmarks.

### You're in Control
Need to stick strictly to your brand colors? Or just want the text to be readable no matter what? You can now choose:

- **Ultra Strict**: We'll barely touch your colors.
- **Default**: The perfect balance of style and readability.
- **Relaxed**: We'll do whatever it takes to make it readable.

### Aim Higher
Want to go beyond the basics? Use the new `premium` option to aim for the highest readability standard (AAA), making your site even more accessible.
